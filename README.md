# CSCI 572: Information Retrieval - Fall 2024

Welcome to the repository for **CSCI 572: Information Retrieval** under Professor **Saty** for **Fall 2024**. This repository contains my assignments for the course, organized by assignment number. Each assignment showcases the implementation of various information retrieval concepts and techniques.

## Course Overview

This course covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of information retrieval, including:

- Text processing
- Indexing
- Search algorithms
- Relevance ranking
- Evaluation metrics
- Web search and retrieval
- Clustering and classification techniques
- Introduction to LLMs (Large Language Models) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- [**Assignment 1**: Web Search Engine Comparison](Assignment%201/)
- [**Assignment 2**: Web Crawling](Assignment%202/)
- [**Assignment 3**: Inverted Index](Assignment%203/)
- [**Assignment 4**: LLMs + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](Assignment%204/)

Each folder contains the relevant code, documentation, and any required datasets.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Web Search Engine Comparison

- Compared the search results from Google and another assigned search engine (e.g., Bing, Yahoo!, Ask, DuckDuckGo).
- Scraped search results using a Python script.
- Computed metrics like **percent overlap** and **Spearman's rank correlation coefficient** to analyze ranking correlations.
- Delivered a comprehensive report comparing the search engines' performance.

### Assignment 2: Web Crawling

- Utilized **crawler4j** (Java-based web crawler) to crawl a pre-assigned news website.
- Configured the crawler to fetch up to 20,000 pages and recorded metadata (status codes, file sizes, content types).
- Analyzed and reported statistics on successful and failed fetches, unique URLs, and file sizes.

### Assignment 3: Inverted Index

- Built an **inverted index** using Python to store term-document mappings.
- Implemented efficient search and retrieval operations using the index.
- Evaluated the index's performance with given datasets and queries.

### Assignment 4: LLMs + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Explored **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **RAG** to create a question-answering system.
- Implemented RAG pipelines to retrieve relevant documents from a corpus and generate answers using LLMs.
- Documented the process and presented results showcasing the effectiveness of the approach.
